<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
How can I predict 80% accuracy in house sales price in King county, USA for the next 12 months considering the period sales price from May 2014 to May 2015? 


<h2>Background</h2>
House prices increase every year, so there is a need for a system to predict house prices in the future. House price prediction can help the developer determine the selling price of a house and can help the customer to arrange the right time to purchase a house. There are three factors that influence the price of a house which include physical conditions, concept and location. This research aims to predict house prices in King county with the OLS Regression model. 



<h2>Key Findings</h2>

- <b> From 2014 to 2015, there was a significant 52% decrease in the overall total house sales price in King County.</b>
- <b>Out of the 21,613 houses listed for sale in King County, 14,633 were sold in 2014 and 6,980 were sold in 2015, representing approximately 68% and 32% of the 
     overall total price of approximately $11.7 million, respectively. </b>
- <b>Renovated houses commanded a higher price compared to unrenovated ones, with a median price of $600,000 for renovated houses and $448,000 for unrenovated 
     houses.</b>
- <b>Geographically, the zip codes 98039, 98004, 98040, and 98112, corresponding to Medina, Bellevue, Mercer Island, and Seattle, respectively, had the highest 
     overall house sales prices. </b>
- <b>Houses with 3 bathrooms, 8 bedrooms, and 2.5 floors fetched the highest sales prices.</b>
- <b>Houses viewed three times and those in excellent condition achieved the highest sales prices. Among graded houses, grade 13, the highest grade, recorded the highest sales prices.</b>
- <b>The average price of houses with waterfront views was twice as high as those without waterfront views.</b>



<h2>Recommendations</h2>

- <b>Analyze Market Trends: Conduct a thorough analysis of market trends and economic factors to understand the reasons behind the significant decline in house 
     sales prices from 2014 to 2015. This analysis can help identify any systemic issues or market shifts that may have contributed to the decline.</b>
- <b>Renovation Strategy: Given the higher median price of renovated houses, consider implementing a renovation strategy for properties before listing them for 
     sale. Assess the cost-effectiveness of renovations and prioritize upgrades that are most likely to increase the property's value.</b>
- <b>Target High-Value Areas: Focus marketing efforts and investment in areas with high average house sales prices, such as zip codes 98039, 98004, 98040, and 
     98112. Develop targeted marketing campaigns to attract potential buyers to properties in these areas.</b>
- <b>Optimize Property Features: Identify the specific features, such as the number of bathrooms, bedrooms, and floors, that contribute to higher sales prices. 
     Tailor property listings to highlight these features and emphasize their value to potential buyers.</b>
- <b>Enhance Property Presentation: Invest in professional photography and staging to showcase properties in the best possible light. Highlight unique selling 
     points, such as waterfront views, excellent condition, and high-grade ratings, to attract buyer interest.</b>
- <b>Review Pricing Strategy: Evaluate the Average Daily Rate (ADR) and pricing structure to ensure competitiveness within the market while maintaining 
     profitability, considering factors such as demand trends 
     and guest preferences.</b>
- <b>Pricing Strategy: Develop a strategic pricing strategy based on market research and analysis of comparable properties. Set competitive prices that reflect 
     the value of the property while remaining attractive to potential buyers.<b>
- <b>Consider Waterfront Properties: Given the higher average price of houses with waterfront views, explore opportunities to acquire or develop waterfront 
     properties. Conduct feasibility studies to assess the potential return on investment for waterfront properties.<b>
- <b>Monitor Market Conditions: Stay informed about market conditions and trends to adapt strategies and pricing accordingly. Regularly review and adjust 
     marketing tactics, pricing strategies, and property features to remain competitive in the market.<b>
 

 <h2>Prediction Based on OLS Regression</h2>
- <b>Based on the OLS regression results showing that 60% of the variation in house sales price can be explained by all the independent variables, we can predict that these variables collectively have a moderate level of predictive power in determining house sales prices. However, it's important to note that there may be other factors not included in the model that could also influence house prices. Therefore, while the model provides valuable insights, it may not capture the full complexity of the housing market.<b>
