<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
How can I predict 80% accuracy in house sales price in King county, USA for the next 12 months considering the period sales price from May 2014 to May 2015? 


<h2>Background</h2>
House prices increase every year, so there is a need for a system to predict house prices in the future. House price prediction can help the developer determine the selling price of a house and can help the customer to arrange the right time to purchase a house. There are three factors that influence the price of a house which include physical conditions, concept and location. This research aims to predict house prices in King county with the OLS Regression model. 



<h2>Key Findings</h2>

- <b>Hotel Type: The City hotel receives the highest patronage, totaling 79,330 bookings, surpassing the Resort hotel. However, City hotels also experienced the highest number of cancellations compared to the 
     Resort hotel.</b>
- <b>Peak Booking Periods: August emerges as the peak booking period with 13,877 bookings, followed by July and May. These months coincide with the summer season, a time when vacation travel is prevalent. </b>
- <b>Demographic Preferences: Approximately 28.6% of all guests originated from Portugal, followed by Great Britain, France, Spain, and Germany. This suggests that the majority of hotel guests hail from European 
     countries.</b>
- <b>Market Segments/Booking channels: Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) accounted for 47.3% of total bookings, amounting to 56,477 reservations. </b>
- <b>Highest ADR (Average Daily Rate): Daniel Walter from Portugal recorded the highest Average Daily Rate of $5,400 at a City hotel, without eligibility for a refund.</b>
- <b>Cancellation Rates: The absence of deposits for most bookings contributed to a significant number of cancellations. Deposits serve as a commitment indicator for guests to honor their reservations.</b>
- <b>Customer Retention: Repeated guests comprise only 3.19% of total bookings, indicating that the majority of reservations are made by first-time guests or customers.</b>
 
 


<h2>Recommendations</h2>

- <b>Cancellation Management Strategies: Implement measures to mitigate cancellations, particularly for City hotels, such as introducing flexible cancellation policies or requiring deposits for bookings to 
     ensure commitment from guests.</b>
- <b>Seasonal Pricing Strategy: Capitalize on peak booking periods in August, July, and May by implementing dynamic pricing strategies to maximize revenue during high-demand seasons.</b>
- <b>Targeted Marketing Campaigns: Leverage demographic preferences to tailor marketing efforts towards European countries, focusing on promotions and offers that appeal to guests from Portugal, Great Britain, 
     France, Spain, and Germany.</b>
- <b>Enhanced Online Presence: Strengthen partnerships with Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) to further penetrate the online booking market segment, optimizing visibility and accessibility for potential guests.</b>
- <b>Customer Loyalty Programs: Develop initiatives to increase customer retention, such as loyalty programs or personalized offers for repeated guests, to foster long-term relationships and encourage repeat 
     bookings.</b>
- <b>Review Pricing Strategy: Evaluate the Average Daily Rate (ADR) and pricing structure to ensure competitiveness within the market while maintaining profitability, considering factors such as demand trends 
     and guest preferences.</b>
- <b>Optimization of Room Allocation: Allocate resources and prioritize inventory management strategies to accommodate fluctuations in demand during peak booking periods, ensuring efficient utilization of hotel 
     facilities and maximizing revenue potential.<b>
